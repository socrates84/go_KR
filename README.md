Welcome to my first Go Project!!! 
===============================

Purpose
=======
The purpose of this project is to 

1) go (no pun intended!) through the The C Programing Language - by K&R and try to solve the exercises in it using go instead of C.

2) learn a modern system programming language that is much safer than c. 

3) prepare for other interesting go projects out there.

4) share my source code here and gain insights from other programmers.

Audience
========
I welcome both beginners and experts in improving the code I share
